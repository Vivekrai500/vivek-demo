# untracked file means new files that git doesn't yet track or not known to git
# first you modify your code then you have to follow below two step add and commit

# Add and commit is used for if you change anything in your vs code then git is modified then you have to add and commit for make the same changes in you github also if you want to save it in github then only

# git add<filename> or git add.

# for commit means the record of commit history use this keyword git commit -m "some message"

# push command is used to push them to github origin use this keyword "git push origin main"

If you want to make a folder and then you have to push that folder on github for that add and commit is done then write one more code before writing push code 
the code is "git remote add origin <link>"

for new branch we have to write git checkout -b "nameof branch you made"

if we want to delete a branch then write git branch -d feature1

if we want to switch the branch then write git checkout" other branch name written here"
